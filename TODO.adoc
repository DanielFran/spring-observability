== Production code

- Unify the API (in some places we use getters and in others we don't - like `listeners()` but `getContext()`)
- Update Javadocs
- Write the docs
- LongTaskTimer, Gauge?
- `record(runnable)`,  record(callable)?
- throw exceptions vs. log warn (or first warn then debug log)?
- `NamingConvention`? (see Micrometer)

== Test code

- In some places we use `BDDAssertions.then()` in some we use `Assertions.assertThat()`
- We use `BDDMockito` and `Mockito`
- different test naming conventions `onXshouldY`, `shouldXWhenY`
